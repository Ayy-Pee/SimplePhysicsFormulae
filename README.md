# SimplePhysicsFormulae
# Date of creation: 5 October 2022
This repository contains programs that will help you calculate values based on given data.
So, basically for the sake of practicing java and revising my physics lessons I made these programs. These programs are not really meant for use but if want to then
you are always free.

I will be adding more programs as I clear new concepts in physics and will also try to make the code more efficient and neat as I learn more.

fyi - I am 15 y/o 9th grader, ICSE school
